# YouTube-comment-analysis

This project performs various analyses on YouTube comments, including sentiment analysis, comment analysis, time-based analysis, emotion analysis, and toxicity detection. The goal is to provide insights into the sentiment, patterns, emotions, and toxicity of comments on YouTube videos.

## Features:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**  
   Analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of YouTube comments using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

   **Code**:  
   - This module uses text classification models (such as VADER or custom sentiment classifiers) to assign sentiment scores to comments.
   - Visualizes sentiment distribution in comments.

2. **Comment Analysis**  
   Analyzes the content and patterns in the comments, including comment length, likes, and other text features.

   **Code**:  
   - This section processes the comments to extract various metrics like comment length, the number of likes, and any specific insights such as common keywords or phrases.

3. **Time-based Analysis**  
   Analyzes the comments based on the time they were posted, identifying trends and patterns related to the time of day or day of the week.

   **Code**:  
   - The module converts timestamps to hours and days of the week, then visualizes comment activity over time.

4. **Emotion Analysis**  
   Detects emotional tones in YouTube comments, categorizing them into emotional categories like joy, anger, sadness, etc.

   **Code**:  
   - Uses emotion detection models to classify comments into different emotions, then plots a distribution of emotions across all comments.

5. **Toxicity Detection**  
   Detects toxic comments, such as those containing hate speech, abusive language, or offensive content.

   **Code**:  
   - The toxicity detection model analyzes comments and classifies them as toxic or non-toxic using predefined thresholds and machine learning models like Google's Perspective API or custom toxicity classifiers.
